# here-and-there
A experimental program for my algorithmic class.
Here are some little mathematical games.
The first one is almost there, I still need to package it as a function and add new features to the coin systems, maybe some items ^.^.
The second one (maybe a number circle related to circular linked list, or something like a mysterious clock...) is still planning, maybe you need enough coins to unlock the second game.
