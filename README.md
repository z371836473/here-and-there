# here-and-there
A experimental program for my algorithmic class.
Here are some little mathematical games.
The first one is almost there, though many bugs to fix and new features to add.
The second one (maybe a number circle related to circular linked list, or something like a mysterious clock...) is still planning, there is still no idea on how to connect those games.
