# here-and-there
A experimental program for my algorithmic class.
Now I am thinking about some little mathematical games.
Use txt to save your game and load it automatically every time you run this program, no need to prevent artificially changes from your fingers.
First, find out the different number between several numbers that are produced by one particular number, but that's not the end, the further part will be added later. Maybe I will use "random" to get the different number. 
Added soon: The way how to get the particular number; Colorful words;
Second, this is something related to a circular linked list, I mean the status of several numbers are similar to that, though I don't know what to do with that. Maybe something like a mysterious clock...
Something more, if Otomadmt sees this, just...change your icon...ermm...it's really a little scary.
